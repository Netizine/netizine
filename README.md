### Hi there, Im James ðŸ‘‹

Im what you could consider a **netizine** of the web. 

âš¡ Fun fact: Able to sit in my chair for extended periods of time without numbness or fatigue and openly admit that If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then I guess you can define my programming methodology as the process of putting them in. Born to take risks, love what I do and always trying to push the boundaries.
